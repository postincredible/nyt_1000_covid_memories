# nyt_1000_covid_memories

This is a text mining / NLP project in exploring the 1,000 memories from NYT's covid-19 victims report at
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/24/us/us-coronavirus-deaths-100000.html


From the uploaded notebook file, you will be able to do the following:

1) Parse the 1,000 memories' information into dataframe with 5 features,'memo', 'name', 'age', 'city_county', and 'state'.

2) A world cloud built on words from 'memo'.

3) Topic model based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
